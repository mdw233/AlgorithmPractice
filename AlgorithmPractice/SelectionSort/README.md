Selection Sort
====================

The basic approach goes like this:

1. Find the smallest value, swap it with the first value.
2. Find the 2nd smalled value, swap it with the 2nd value.
3. Find the 3rd smallest value, swap it with the 3rd value.
4. Keep going until we get to the end of the array - at which time it is sorted.













My Own Initial Notes:

 * Very ill-performing because it is running a worst-case linear search over and over
